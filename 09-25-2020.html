                    A few days ago, my brother approached me with a "project" that he wanted my help with. He is
                    currently developing his own professional-grade graphics engine which is -- suffice to say --
                    a rather ambitious endeavor (especially alone). He explained that he could really use a web site to
                    act as a designated download/information hub for each new build of his engine. More specifically:
                    he wanted something that would listen for each new push to his GitHub repository, retrieve the new
                    build, and automatically upload it to his own website. </p>

                <p class="blog-text-p blog-text-p-sm">Admittedly, I started this endeavor with near-zero knowledge of
                    how to <i>any</i> of this. However, I took this as an excellent opportunity to learn
                    new, useful things. And one of the first useful things I learned was how to use GitHub's built-in
                    WebHook system for repositories. The process for receiving notifications from GitHub
                    is actually quite simple:</p>

                <p class="blog-text-p blog-text-p-sm"><a class="blog-thumb-url" href="media/blog1img1.png"
                        target="_blank"><img src="media/blog1img1.png" class="blog-thumb blog thumb-sm"></a></p>
                <p class="blog-text-p blog-text-p-sm">If you open up your repository and navigate to <b>Settings</b>,
                    you'll see <b>WebHook</b> is listed right there under the left navigation menu. Unfortunately (or
                    fortunately, depending
                    on your perspective), the WebHook setting is only available to repository-owners, and not to
                    collaborators.</p>
                <p class="blog-text-p blog-text-p-sm"><a class="blog-thumb-url" href="media/blog1img2.png"
                        target="_blank"><img src="media/blog1img2.png" class="blog-thumb blog thumb-sm"></a></p>

                <p class="blog-text-p blog-text-p-sm"></p>

                <!-- <p class="blog-text-p">How do I create a class design that is structured to both:</p>
                <ul class="blog-text-p">
                    <li class="blog-text-span">A.) store perfectly parsed, sorted, and organized JSON Objects from any structurally-valid JSON source</li>
                    <li class="blog-text-span">B.) generate child/parent relationship mappings for all stored JSON Objects *all* levels of
                            complexity</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="blog-text-p">   
                It doesn't seem that difficult on the surface, I know. I've already successfully coded several
                iterations of my parser that work flawlessly when parsing a family of JSON objects whose
                relationship depth is less like a "tree" and more like a "sapling".

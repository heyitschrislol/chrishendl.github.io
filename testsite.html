					My name is Chris Hendl. I am an application developer experienced in many
					programming/markup/scripting/database
					languages such as: C#, Java, VB.Net, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, SQL, and XML. I thoroughly enjoy making
					programs as
					both a professional skill and personal hobby.

				</p>
				<p class="about-info" style="margin-bottom: 2em">
					I understand how important knowledge and experience are to personal and professional growth, and I
					am someone who is passionate about learning and achieving. As an LSU graduate majoring in Information
					Systems and Decision Sciences, I aspire to one day gain professional experience working with IS, IT, and Big
					Data.

				<p class="about-info" style="margin-bottom: 10em">
					In March 2019, I started a position as an Application Developer at the IBM CIC in Baton Rouge, LA. This has proven to be a very
					exciting opportunity for me to hone my professional skillset and advance my career goals. In July, I completed a 2-week Java Bootcamp.
					Since then, I have begun and completed several personal "passion" projects using Java, utilizing popular
					industry APIs/frameworks/utilities such as JDBC, JavaFX, Maven, and JSP (<b>I hope to have examples of these up soon</b>). On August 31st 2019 I finished my
					first client project, working with IBM's Financial Transaction Manager system.
					<!-- We found ourselves on the, less prepared
					side of things when Stanley had his-- when his heart went bezerk. And I knew exactly what
					to do but in a much more real sense I had <i>no idea</i> what to do. So I thought we should have
					a CPR training class. And... of course you can't get the practice dummy, unless the
					instructor comes along with it. Red Cross... racquet. -->

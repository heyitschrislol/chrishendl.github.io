			My name is Chris Hendl. I am an application developer experienced in many
			programming/markup/scripting/database
			languages such as: C#, Java, VB.Net, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, SQL, and XML. I thoroughly enjoy making
			programs as
			both a professional skill and personal hobby.

		</p>
		<p class="content ab-content" style="margin-bottom: 2em">
			I understand how important knowledge and experience are to personal and professional growth, and I
			am someone who is passionate about learning and achieving. As an LSU graduate majoring in Information
			Systems and Decision Sciences, I aspire to one day gain professional experience working with IS, IT, and Big
			Data.
		</p>
		<p class="content ab-content" style="margin-bottom: 10em">
			In March 2019, I started a position as an Application Developer at the IBM CIC in Baton Rouge, LA. I am very
			excited
			for this opportunity to hone my professional skillset and advance my career goals.
			<!-- We found ourselves on the, less prepared
			side of things when Stanley had his-- when his heart went bezerk. And I knew exactly what
			to do but in a much more real sense I had <i>no idea</i> what to do. So I thought we should have
			a CPR training class. And... of course you can't get the practice dummy, unless the
			instructor comes along with it. Red Cross... racquet. -->

							<b>WHY: </b><span>The original intention behind writing this program was to help my
								girlfriend with her accounting homework.
								I thought I could use what I was learning in class to make something that would
								alleviate some of the repetitiveness of her accounting homework calculations.
								Truth be told, a large part of my motivation came from excitement at what I was learning
								in class, and I was rather anxious
								to see what my newfound "knowledge" could do.</span>

					<div>
						<b>HOW: </b><span>This program was created using C# and Visual Studio</span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b>WHY: </b><span>For a few months, I worked at a high-volume helpdesk where we were
							required to keep extensive records of
							each call/interaction and submit them for review. I unfortunately found that the
							recording procedure that we were trained to
							perform each and every call was extremely clunky and disorganized, with each monitor
							divided into multiple applications that
							were resized into awkward "sections" in order to fit the other necessary applications.

							I decided in my free time that I would create a program that combined the functions of
							several of the applications into one
							small program in hopes to provide a little less chaos to the recording process.

					<h2>TRACE RSE TOOL</h2>
					<p><a href="https://github.com/heyitschrislol/RSETool">Download (github)</a></p>
					<div>
						<strong>Program Description:</strong>
					</div>
					<p>A tool to manage and organize some of the work involved in running, recording, and reporting
						remote social engineering projects</p>
					<div>
						<b>HOW: </b><span>This program was created using C# and Visual Studio</span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b>WHY: </b><span>The goal of the RSE Tool was to help TraceSecurity employees manage
							remote social engineering campaigns
							more easily. This tool can extract project scoping data from documents (such as client
							employee names, phone numbers, and email addresses)
							and reorganize/reformat/relabel the information so that it is readable and usable by
							other programs. This feature is particularly useful
							for projects where the scoping information received from the client is poorly organized
							and/or labeled, and would otherwise force the analyst
							to copy/paste items line-by-line.</span>
					</div>
					<div style="text-indent: 30px;">
						<p>Another useful feature of this program is that it allows the user to quickly locate the
							desired email template and
							copy its HTML code to the computer clipboard. It is also capable of adding new templates
							(locally) to its list for use in the future.</p>
